# 🎯 Migration Sessions: The Playbook

## The Three-Act Drama

### SESSION 1: Empty Scaffolding
**"Create modern-ext/, don't touch anything else"**
- ✅ Build empty .NET 8 projects in `modern-ext/`
- ✅ Cross-platform tests from day one
- ❌ Zero functionality - just structure

### SESSION 2: Stub & Break  
**"Get it to compile, even if fake"**
- ✅ Upgrade `src/` from Framework 4.5.2 → .NET 8
- ✅ Create stub implementations for WITSML operations
- ✅ **ONLY** Desktop.Core + WitsmlBrowser (let other plugins burn 🔥)
- ✅ Upgrade existing test projects alongside
- ❌ Nothing actually works - just compiles

### SESSION 3: Make It Real
**"Replace stubs with SOAP, still just WitsmlBrowser"**
- ✅ Generate real SOAP client from WSDL
- ✅ Extract **3-5 files max** from ext/witsml (50,000+ LOC ignored!)
- ✅ Test with mock servers, console apps, real servers
- ❌ Still ignoring other plugins, main Desktop app

### SESSION 4: Fix Integration
**"Make src/ and modern-ext/ play nice"**
- ✅ Fix all integration points between layers
- ✅ Add missing interfaces/extensions to WitsmlFramework
- ✅ Create minimal RuntimeService
- ✅ Solution builds with 0 errors
- ❌ Still no UI, just compilation

### SESSION 5: Prove It Works
**"Run the damn thing"**
- ✅ Build mock WITSML server for testing
- ✅ Run integration tests against mock/real servers
- ✅ Console app validates SOAP operations
- ✅ WPF loads (on Windows)
- ✅ Performance baseline established

## 🔑 Key Strategic Decisions

### Two Parallel Universes
| `ext/` Approach | `src/` Approach |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Complete Rebuild** | **In-Place Upgrade** |
| Create new in `modern-ext/` | Modify existing code |
| Cross-platform .NET 8 | Windows-only .NET 8 |
| Regenerate from WSDL | Keep WPF intact |
| Skip 50,000+ LOC of legacy | Selective component upgrade |

### The Great Abandonment
**What We're NOT Migrating:**
- ❌ ETP Browser (WebSocket nightmare)
- ❌ Data Replay plugin
- ❌ Object Inspector
- ❌ Store/MongoDB components
- ❌ 50,000+ lines of legacy ext/witsml code
- ❌ Main Desktop app (until Session 4+)

**What We ARE Migrating:**
- ✅ WitsmlBrowser plugin
- ✅ Desktop.Core (minimal subset)
- ✅ SOAP operations (regenerated fresh)
- ✅ 3-5 utility files from ext/

## 🧪 Testing Philosophy

### Two Test Suites
1. **modern-ext/WitsmlClient.Tests**
   - New, cross-platform
   - Tests SOAP client
   - Runs on Linux/Mac/Windows

2. **src/Desktop.IntegrationTest & Desktop.UnitTest**  
   - Existing, upgraded to .NET 8
   - Tests WPF/ViewModels
   - Windows-only

### Progressive Validation
```
Session 1: Can it build? ✅
Session 2: Can it compile with stubs? ✅
Session 3: Can it actually call SOAP? ✅
Session 4+: Can users use it? 🤷
```

### Test Coverage Reality
- **NOT the goal**: 100% coverage
- **The goal**: Quick sanity checks
- **The mantra**: "Write a test when you're scared"

## 💣 Breaking Change Philosophy

**Session 2 Wisdom:**
> "The .NET Framework 4.5.2 app does NOT need to keep running!"

Translation: 
- ✅ OK to break everything
- ✅ Mixed frameworks won't work anyway
- ✅ Success = WitsmlBrowser works standalone
- ❌ Backwards compatibility is dead

## 🎪 The Big Reveals

1. **ext/witsml is SO legacy it makes Framework 4.5.2 look modern**
   - SuperWebSocket 0.9 (seriously?)
   - Apache.Avro 1.7.7 (2013 called)
   - System.Web.Services (RIP)

2. **We're extracting 3-5 files from 50,000+ LOC**
   - That's a 99.99% reduction
   - WSDL regeneration > legacy migration

3. **Desktop.Core isn't just for WitsmlBrowser**
   - Shared by all plugins
   - But we only migrate what WitsmlBrowser needs
   - Other plugins can wait (forever?)

## 🚀 Success Metrics

**Session 1**: Empty projects that build ✅  
**Session 2**: Broken app that compiles ✅  
**Session 3**: WitsmlBrowser sends real SOAP ✅  
**Session 4**: Everything compiles together ✅  
**Session 5**: Someone can actually use it 🎯

## The Ultimate Goal
**One plugin working on .NET 8 > Entire app broken on Framework 4.5.2**
